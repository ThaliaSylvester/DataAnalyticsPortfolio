Feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile here: www.linkedin.com/in/thaliasylvester

Hello! My name is Thalia Sylvester, and I am a recent Management Information Systems + Marketing graduate from McCombs UT. 
I developed a passion for using data to solve problems and analyzing information to gain meaningful insights. As a naturally inquisitive person, my curiosity has made me a grate candid for analytical positions because of my drive to uncover answerers in data. To me, data is like a puzzleâ€”when carefully examined and pieced together, it can create something remarkable.

Throughout my academic career, I gained proficiency in SQL, Python, R, and C#, while also mastering tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MATLAB. I have a deep understanding of data architecture and a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. This portfolio is a collection of data analysis projects I have developed to showcase the skills and progress.
